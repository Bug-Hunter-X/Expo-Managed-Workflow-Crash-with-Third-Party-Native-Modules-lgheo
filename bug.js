While working on an Expo project, I encountered an unusual error related to the interaction between Expo's managed workflow and a third-party library that uses native modules.  The error wasn't consistent, only appearing on certain devices and under specific circumstances (like low memory conditions). The Expo Go app would simply crash without providing a clear error message in the console.  The native code within the third-party library was already optimized and tested separately.  Debugging the error required considerable time as it wasn't reproducible on every test device.
