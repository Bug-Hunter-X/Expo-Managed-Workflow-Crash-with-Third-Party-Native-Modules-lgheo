# Expo Managed Workflow Crash with Third-Party Native Modules

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in an Expo managed workflow application when using a third-party library with native modules. The bug causes the Expo Go app to crash inconsistently, primarily on certain devices and under specific conditions such as low memory situations. The crash provides no clear error messages in the console, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description
The issue arises from the interaction between Expo's managed workflow and a third-party library that incorporates native modules.  The exact cause remains elusive; however, the crash seems to correlate with resource constraints on the device.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Attempt to trigger the crash by performing actions that consume significant device resources (e.g., running intensive background tasks simultaneously).
5. Observe the crash in Expo Go without any informative error messages.

## Solution
The solution involved a combination of strategies. Initially, it was important to rule out issues in the native modules of the third-party library. Once that was confirmed, the focus shifted to improving the handling of memory and resource management within the application itself, by implementing robust error handling practices and memory optimization.
